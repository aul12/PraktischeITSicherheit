    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Attestation is used to verify the integrity of an enclave:
        \begin{itemize}[<+->]
            \item Verifies that the code is trustable
            \item That the enclave Code isn't tampered
        \end{itemize}
        \item For attestation a report will be generated by enclave, which contains the identity, enclaves measurement and a supplied message from other enclave
        \item Report is signeencrypted by the enclave with a symmetric key between target enclave and SGX Implementation
        \item Attestation is for a data exchange between 2 enclaves on same CPU or via remote 
    \end{itemize}

                \item Enclave A receives the enclave Measure (MRENCLAVE) from enclave B via an established channel
                \item Enclave A generates the report for B with MRENCLAVE and send the report back so B can verify with EGETKEY the report
                \item Enclave B generates the report for A with the MRENCLAVE from A and sends it back to get verified from A

                \item Report is send to quoting enclave (QE)
                \item QE converts local report to remote report (Quote) and sends back
                \item Challegner receives quote

    \frametitle{Sealing}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Secrets of an enclave gets lost when enclave is closed
        \item Process of encrypting enclave secrets for persistent storage is called sealing
        \item The data can be signed with different keys
        \item Enclave retrieves the seal Key using the EGETKEY instruction, which returns a cryptographical key
        \item Enclaves can seal data with MRSIGNER as key, so no toher enclave is able to read data
        \item Other key is MRSIGNER, so every enclave with same author can read each others data
