Intelâ€™s Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is a set of extensions to the Intel architecture that aims to provide integrity and confidentiality guarantees to security-sensitive
computation performed on a computer where all privileged software (kernel, hypervisor, etc) is potentially malicious \cite{Costan2016IntelSE}. It includes new instructions
and a programming model that allow a developer to place sensitive information inside isolated computation environments (so called Enclaves) where it is protected against
unauthorized access even by entities with a higher privilege level. In this report the basic principles of Intel SGX are explained. For a very detailed explanation please refer
to \cite{Costan2016IntelSE}.
