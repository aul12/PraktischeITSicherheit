\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
Nowadays, outsourcing computation to remote entities is common practice, whether it be as part of an online service or 
in general as part of multi-party applications \cite{UseOfIntelSGX}. 
Alongside the benefits of increased flexibility and scalability this also introduces the challenge of performing secure 
computations in an untrusted and potentially malicious environment. 
This environment includes other software running on the same host but also the \ac{os} and hypervisor running
on the machine.
It is difficult to guarantee the security of all data purely using software, especially when considering a potentially 
malicious, but more privileged, \ac{os} or hypervisor.

Intel \ac{sgx} provides a hardware based solution to this problem: new features and instructions are added to the processor
in order to store data in special memory which can not be accessed by unauthorized parties, even if they are more
privileged. Additionally Intel \ac{sgx} provides the necessary instructions for attestation, so that it is possible to
verify the integrity of the program handling the confidential data.

This report will first explain how Intel \ac{sgx} works by explaining the mechanisms implemented by Intel. In the next
part there will be stuff.
